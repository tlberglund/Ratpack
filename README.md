Ratpack
=======

A Micro Web Framework for Groovy
--------------------------------

This project is the core Ratpack code. It is of interest to developers wanting to extend the Ratpack framework itselfâ€”which hopefully means you!

If you just want to use Ratpack to build a small, Groovy-based web app, then you want the [Ratpack Template](https://github.com/tlberglund/ratpack-template). Go clone that, write your code, and come on back here when you want to hack on the framework.
